        <h1>A small introduction is going to be held here. It will navigate the visitor to <a href="visuals-copy" rel="history">VISUALS</a>â€ƒ<a href="Tangibles" rel="history">TANGIBLES</a>, and <a href="about" rel="history">ABOUT</a> pages. It will be way longer. Maybe also with some external links to CV and Social Medias.It is still a test version, so I can develope it later.</h1>
